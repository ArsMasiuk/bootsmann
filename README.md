# Bootsmann
A minimalistic, multiplatform REST API test application.

## Key Features
- **Minimalistic**: Designed to be lightweight and easy to use - low memory footprint and resource usage.
- **Native Code**: Built with a C++ compiler - no Electron or other web-based frameworks used.
- **Direct Calls**: Uses direct system calls to run the requests - no JS-based middleware, therefore fast and efficient.

- **Secure**: Does not upload any user data or API keys, ensuring privacy and security. No registration or login required.
- **Portable**: Can be run directly from the executable without installation, making it portable and easy to use.
- **Multiplatform**: Runs on various operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux - thanks to Qt framework.
- **Intuitive REST API Testing**: Provides a simple graphical interface for testing RESTful APIs.
- **Open Source**: Available under the MIT License, allowing for free use, modification, and distribution.
